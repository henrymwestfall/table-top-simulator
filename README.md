# Table Top Simulator

This is a basic table top simulator written in Python and PyGame using socketing.

To begin the server, run `python3 server.py`. Some versions of PyGame will open a new
PyGame window. Ignore this.

To begin clients, run `python3 game.py`. This currently only works on localhost.
